        <h2>Most unique experience I've had</h2>

        <p>7. One of the most unique experiences I've had is probably cliff jumping.
            I remember my first time my friends brought me along a river where a
            cliff jumping spot was. I wasn't too sure at first but they peer pressured
            me a little and convinced me to go. When looking at the cliff I was jumping
            off of, it didn't look too high. Swimming over to the cliff was very tiring
            as well because I'm such a bad swimmer which terrified me even more. When I
            got to the top of the cliff, it looked about 3 times higher than what it was
            when I was on the ground looking up. I was told it was a 45 foot drop, my first
            cliff jump! After a few minutes of getting prepared I jumped but accidently looked
            down and got a bloody nose coming out of the water and almost a black eye.</p>
